        "When defining a subclass that implements an interface, it's important to ensure that all required methods are implemented as specified by the interface. In Python, you can use the `abc` module to define abstract base classes that require certain methods to be implemented by any class that uses the interface. This can be very useful as it forces anyone who implements the interface to also implement all the necessary methods. If you try to create a subclass that doesn't implement all the required methods, Python will raise a TypeError indicating that the class does not provide an implementation for the missing method. For example, if you define an interface called IFlyingObject with methods `fly()` and `land()`, and then define a subclass called Airplane that implements `fly()` but not `land()`, Python will raise a TypeError indicating that Airplane does not provide an implementation for `land()`. By enforcing strict adherence to interfaces in this way, you can help ensure that objects behave as expected and promote code reuse and maintainability."
